Websocket stuff is in the aptly named corresponding folder.

To run the socket on MacOS, simply type `python3 driver.py` in Terminal. To stop it, you'll have to Ctrl+C stop the
process.

Linux is similar I think.

To run it on Windows, I think the command should be `py -3 driver.py` to start it, and the same to stop it.

Backtester stuff will be in `backtester stuff`.
